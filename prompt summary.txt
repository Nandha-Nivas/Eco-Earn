We used a single detailed prompt in OnSpace AI to:
• Generate a complete backend system
• Create authentication (login/register)
• Create plant tracking logic
• Add image upload & verification
• Implement rewards, penalties, badges & leaderboard
• Fix the “Submit Check-in button not working” bug
• Add a marketplace cart feature
• Connect frontend with backend APIs

Instead of using Supabase, OnSpace AI:
✔ Automatically created its own backend services
✔ Hosted APIs on its own cloud
✔ Managed database internally
✔ Managed image storage internally

The prompt focused on:
• Business logic (reward/penalty rules)
• Security (user vs admin access)
• Feature completeness
• Bug fixing
• Scalability
