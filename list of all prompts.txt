PROBLEM STATEMENT:
	“How can individuals be made accountable for plant care while also benefiting economically from environmental actions?”

 in simple word,Plant a tree, make sure it is growing good and claim the reward.

STEPS:
we will sell seeds to the registered user
1. Plant a tree and upload the pic - some reward
2. Upload a pic of tree every month to evaluate that the tree is healthy - some reward
3. When it starts giving the yield - some reward based on the function or type of problem it solves (like purifies the most, fruits, vegetables, medicinal...)
4. When a plant which they grown dies - a small kind of penalty.
5. Earn badges kind of stuff....
6. Ranking based on the number of plants they grown, their health..etc;

NOTE: 
	1.Every reward is cash reward only. 
	2. When a plant dies due to natural calamity in that region, then no penalty.
	3. When the plant reaches its yielding stage, rewards will be awarded only on the yielding and no further monthly reward is awarded on that plant.
FLAWS:
	1. Validation of the image(whether its real or not)
NEW IDEA:
	1. Give coupons for the users, to purchase seeds from us.
	2. NO share, we will sell the seeds on profit and that's it.
Build a full-working website and make sure that its interface is optimal without any bugs and also include all the features that are required for my project
Primary User Flow:Track my plants
Check-in Experience:Guided health assessment
Seed Catalog:Reward potential
Reward Tracking:Detailed transaction log
Ranking System:Total plants alive,Environmental impact score,Consistency streak
Now create a login page for this website by taking the basic details from the user. Name the website as "Eco Earn" and add the image that i have attached as Logo of the organization
Also make sure to add a feature and a fix in an existing feature
 in Plant check in - after uploading the image of the plant, make sure submit is working and output is as expected.
Now add a new  cart feature in marketplace
Create a Supabase backend for a tree plantation reward app.
Use Supabase Auth (email/password).
Create these tables with relations:
users (id, name, email, role: user/admin)
plants (id, user_id, plant_type, date_planted, status: alive/dead/yielding, location)
plant_images (id, plant_id, image_url, upload_month, health_status: pending/healthy/unhealthy) rewards (id, user_id, plant_id, amount, reason, date) penalties (id, user_id, plant_id, amount, reason, date) badges (id, user_id, badge_name, date_awarded)
Use Supabase Storage for plant images.
Allow only one image per plant per month.
Admin can:
view all plants verify plant health update plant status When plant health is approved, insert a reward record.
When plant status becomes dead, insert a penalty record.
Create a leaderboard based on:
number of healthy plants total rewards earned
Use Row Level Security so:
users can only access their own plants and images admin can access all data
Generate REST APIs for React frontend.
My frontend already exists, only generate backend and APIs.
in plant check-in section, even after i upload a picture the "Submit Check-in" button is not responding. Fix this
